# BU_1_1_Final_Project

## This was my very frist project using python. When I was fresh men 2020
I named this project "Young-Money" 
The main purpose is to record my daily spending.
Back then I don't know much about programming but I want to do authentication with knowlage i have so I use file.txt for data base
and using self-made hash function to hide wich user is active in the system.  
## I just want to tank to myself for being creative and encourge me to be more creative and have fun with coding.
